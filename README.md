# Spotify Mood-Based Playlist Generator

This project is a React-based web application that integrates with the Spotify API to create mood-based playlists. It allows users to select their current mood and preferred music genres to generate a personalized Spotify playlist.

## Getting Started

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Clone the repository to your local machine to begin.

## Setup

First, install all the necessary dependencies:

npm install

Set up the required environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of your project. This should include your Spotify API credentials and other necessary configurations.

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode:

npm start

This will start the app on [http://localhost:3001] and server on (http://localhost:3000). Your browser should automatically open to this URL. The application will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.
